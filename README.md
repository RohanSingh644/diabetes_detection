# Diabetes Detection

## Project Overview

The **Diabetes Detection** project is a machine learning application aimed at predicting diabetes in patients based on specific health metrics. By analyzing a set of medical features, this project uses supervised learning to classify whether or not a patient has diabetes, which can aid in early detection and intervention.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Scikit-Learn (StandardScaler, SVM, and other modules)**:
  - **StandardScaler**: For scaling features to improve model accuracy.
  - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: For building the classification model.
  - **Train-Test Split**: For dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
  - **Accuracy Score**: For evaluating model performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Loads and cleans data, handling any missing values.
  - Scales feature data using **StandardScaler** to improve the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

- **Model Training and Testing**:
  - Splits data into training and testing sets to validate the model.
  - Implements **SVM** for classification, a powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks like diabetes detection.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Uses **accuracy_score** to measure model performance on the test data.
